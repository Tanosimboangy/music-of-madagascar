Deniseâ€™s story started in a remote village in Madagascar, where her love for music could be traced to her younger years. Her spotlight came in 2014 when she won the first edition of a Pan African song contest, Island Africa Talent. A favourite from the start, her win earned her a recording deal with Universal Music. This put her music above the rest in French speaking nations, and propelled her to the rest of Africa.
